        <p><br>Annamaria Schreiber is an incredible specimen of a human being who<br> deserves an Oscar for her performative exasperation. She is intelligent <br>(academically and emotionally, always with the Good advice), beautiful (how<br> and when did she get those abs we will never know), and devastatingly<br> funny (almost died a few times choking on her jokes). I love her with my entire<br> heart muscle and miss her so much when we're not in the same place. She's<br> talented and hardworking (goes out of her way to use Helvetica Neue instead<br> of just Helvetica) and always puts together very lovely, matchy outfits. People<br> can count on her, and I always do. I'm razzled and dazzled by you!<br><br><i>With love from Isabel :)</i> <br><br><br></p>
